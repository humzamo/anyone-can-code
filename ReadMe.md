# Anyone Can Code!

##### Explanations, examples, and tasks about some basics of coding that I presented to a call with young people interested in learning how to coding ðŸ§ 

#### What is covered?

- Variables
- Functions (with parameters)
- If/else statement logic

#### Demo

The demo folder has some code which explains the basics and gives some examples. Try having a go at changing some of the example code!

#### Tasks

The tasks folder has some tasks for you to put what you learnt to practice. Have a go at the two tasks and compare your attempts with the answers.

Can you find a way to optimise some of the code in the answers? âœ¨
